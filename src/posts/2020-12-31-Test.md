"Smartypants, double quotes" and 'single quotes'


## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~


## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
>
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Images

With a focus on simplifying API development via boilerplate removal, Tower Web is a lean-yet-powerful Rust framework. It’s built upon Tower, a complimentary library containing useful network components. ![Stormtroopocat](https://unsplash.com/photos/JS0A9bkyI9A/download?force=true "The Stormtroopocat") Much like Actix-web leans on Actix, Tower Web does the same with Tower. It’s also built upon Tokio and Hyper – a non-blocking I/O platform and HTTP client, respectively. As a result, Tower Web is a well-rounded platform ready to tackle Rust API development. It’s also relatively new – Carl Lerche released Tower Web in August of 2018. He currently spearheads development efforts on GitHub, alongside 24 contributors. Since inception, it has been updated 11 times, approximately one release every 22 days. Its current version is v0.3.6.
